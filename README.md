This is an app designed to let users share their reviews for disc golf courses and post their scores to a leaderboard and a Stroke Log. This project was conceived and realized by Zack Biernat a software engineer and avid disc golfer in Fall 2017. Please feel free to contribute to this project by creating a pull request on Github and support our mission to keep this app free and usable for anyone who like to disc golf.
