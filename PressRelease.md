Press Release

~~~FrolfScape~~~

The disc golfer's caddy app.

Summary:
  This app allows disc golfers to share their scores and post reviews for courses they've played.


Problem:
  There's really no good way to track and share your games with the public. This app is meant to be a free reliable way for discers to track their progress and compete with other players.

Solution:
  This app provides a user with a Stroke Log which saves your scores by park. The course database is maintained by users at this point, but will eventually be powered by DiscGolfReview.com.

Quote from You:
  "This app gets you less strokes"
How to Get Started:
  Just download it for free on your mobile device and sign up to track scores.

Customer Quote:
  "I get a great picture of how I'm doing. Also helped me find some good courses while travelling"

Closing and Call to Action:
  Go ahead and download the app and try it out.
